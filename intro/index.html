    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Modern information systems can include a variety of computing platforms (e.g., industrialcontrol systems, general purpose computing systems, cyber-physical systems, super computers, weapons systems, communications systems, environmental control systems, medical devices, embedded devices, sensors, and mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets). These platforms all share a common foundationâ€”computers with complex hardware, software and firmware providing a capability that supports the essential mission and business functions of organizations.</p>
<p>Security controls are the safeguards or countermeasures employed within a system or an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information and to manage information security risk.  Privacy controls are the administrative, technical, and physical safeguards employed within a system or an organization to manage privacy risks and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Security and privacy controls are selected and implemented to satisfy security and privacy requirementslevied on a system or organization. Security and privacy requirements are derived from applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and mission needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information processed, stored, or transmitted and to manage risks to individual privacy</p>
<p>The selection, design, and implementation of security and privacy controls are important tasks that have significant implications for the operations and assets of organizations as well as the welfare of individuals and the Nation. Organizations should answer several key questions when addressing information security and privacy controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>What security and privacy controls are needed to satisfy security and privacy requirementsand to adequately manage mission/business risks or risks to individuals?</li>
<li>Have the selected controls been implemented or is there a plan in place to do so?</li>
<li>What is the required level of assurance (i.e., grounds for confidence) that the selected controls, as designed and implemented, are effective?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions are not given in isolation but rather in the context of a risk management process for the organization that identifies, assesses, responds to, and monitors security and privacy risks arising from its information and systems on an ongoing basis. The security and privacy controls in this publication are recommended for use by organizations to satisfy their information security and privacy requirements. The control catalog can be viewed as a toolbox containing a collection of safeguards, countermeasures, techniques, and processesto respond to security and privacy risks. The controls are employed as part of a well-defined risk management process that supports organizational information security and privacy programs. In turn, those information security and privacy programs lay the foundation for the success of the mission and business functions of the organization</p>
<p>It is important that responsible officials understand the security and privacy risks that could adversely affect organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. These officials must also understand the current status of their security and privacy programs and the controls planned or in place to protect information,  information systems, and organizations in order to make informed judgments and investments that respond to identified risks in an acceptable manner. The objective is to manage these risks through the selection and implementation of security and privacy controls. </p>
<h2 id="11-purpose-and-applicability">1.1 Purpose and Applicability</h2>
<p>This publication establishes controls for systems and organizations. The controls can be implemented within any organization or system that processes, stores, or transmits information. The use of these controls is mandatory for federal information systems in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 [OMB A-130] and the provisions of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act [FISMA], which requires the implementationof minimum controls to protect federal information and information systems. This publication, along with other supporting NIST publications, is designed to help organizations identify the security and privacy controls needed to manage risk and to satisfy the security and privacy requirements in FISMA, the Privacy Act of 1974 [PRIVACT], OMB policies (e.g., [OMB A-130]), and designated Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS),  among others. It accomplishes this objective by providing a comprehensive and flexible catalog of security and privacy controlsto meet current and future protection needs based on changing threats, vulnerabilities, requirements, and technologies. The publication also improves communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that supports the discussion of security, privacy, and risk management concepts.</p>
<p>Finally, the controls are independent of the process employed to select those controls. The control selection process can be part of an organization-wide risk management process, a systems engineering process [SP 800-160-1 ], the Risk Management Framework [SP 800-37], the Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF], or the Privacy Framework [NIST PF]. The control selection criteria can be guided and informed by many factors, including mission and business needs, stakeholder protection needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and requirements to comply with federal laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. The combination of a catalog of security and privacy controls and a risk-based control selection process can help organizations comply with stated security and privacy requirements, obtain adequate security for their information systems, and protect the privacy of individuals.</p>
<h2 id="12-target-audience">1.2 Target Audience</h2>
<p>This publication is intended to serve a diverse audience, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals with system,  information security,  privacy, or risk management and oversight responsibilities, including authorizing officials, chief inf  ormation officers, senior agency information security officers, and senior agency officials for privacy; </li>
<li>Individuals with system development responsibilities, including mission owners, program managers,  system engineers, system security engineers, privacy engineers, hardware and software developers, system integrators,  and acquisition or procurement officials; </li>
<li>Individuals with logistical or disposition-related responsibilities, including program managers, procurement officials, system integrators, and property managers;</li>
<li>Individuals with security and privacy implementation and operations responsibilities, including mission or business owners, system owners, information owners or stewards, system administrators, continuity planners, and system security or privacy officers; </li>
<li>Individuals with security and privacy assessment and monitoring responsibilities, includingauditors, Inspectors General, system evaluators, control assessors, independent verifiers and validators,  and analysts; and</li>
<li>Commercial entities, including industry partners, producing component products and systems, creating security and privacy technologies, or providing services or capabilities that support information security or privacy. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="13-organizational-responsibilities">1.3 Organizational Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Managing security and privacy risks is    a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-defined security and privacy requirements for systems and organization;</li>
<li>The use of trustworthy information system components based on state-of-the-practice hardware, firmware, and software development and acquisition processes;</li>
<li>Rigorous security and privacy planning and system development life cycle management;</li>
<li>The application of system security and privacy engineering principles and practices to securely develop and integrate system components into information systems;</li>
<li>The employment of security and privacy practices that are properly documented and integrated into and supportive of the institutional and operational processes of organizations; and</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring of information systems and organizations to determine the ongoing effectiveness of controls, changes in information systems and environments of operation, and the state of security and privacy organization-wide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations continuously assess the security and privacy risks to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation. Security and privacy risks arise from the planning and execution of organizational mission and business functions,  placing information systems into operation, or continuing system operations. Realistic assessments of risk require a thorough understanding of the susceptibility to threats based on the specific vulnerabilities in information systems and organizations and the likelihood and potential adverse impacts of successful exploitations of such vulnerabilities by those threats. Risk assessments also require an understanding of privacy risks.</p>
<p>To address the organizationâ€™s concerns about assessment and determination of risk, security and privacy requirements are satisfied with the knowledge and understanding of the organizational risk management strategy. The risk management strategy considers the cost, schedule, performance, and supply chain issues associated with the design, development, acquisition, deployment, operation, sustainment, and disposal of organizational systems. A risk management process is then applied to manage risk on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>The catalog of security and privacy controls can be effectively used to protect organizations, individuals, and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats and privacy risks arising from the processing of personally identifiable information (PII) in varied operational, environmental, and technical scenarios. The controls can be used to demonstrate compliance with a variety of governmental, organizational, or institutional security and privacy requirements. Organizations have the responsibility to select the appropriate security and privacy controls, to implement the controls correctly, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controls in satisfying security and privacy requirements. Security and privacy controls can also be used in developing specialized baselines or overlays for unique or specialized missions or business applications, information systems, threat concerns, operational environments, technologies, or communities of interest.</p>
<p>Organizational risk assessments are used, in part, to inform the security and privacy control selection process. The selection process results in an agreed-upon set of security and privacy controls addressing specific mission or business needs consistent with organizational risk tolerance. The process preserves, to the greatest extent possible, the agility and flexibility that organizations need to address an increasingly sophisticated and hostile threat space, mission and business requirements, rapidly changing technologies, complex supply chains, and manytypes of operational environments.</p>
<h2 id="14-relationship-to-other-publications">1.4 Relationship to Other Publications</h2>
<p>This publication defines controls to satisfy a diverse set of security and privacy requirements that have been levied on information systems and organizations and that are consistent with and complementary to other recognized national and international information security and privacy standards. To develop a broadly applicable and technically sound set of controls for information systems and organizations, many sources were considered during the development of this    publication. These sources included requirements and controls from the manufacturing, defense, financial, healthcare, transportation, energy, intelligence, industrial control, and audit communities as well as national and international standards organizations. In addition, the controls in this publication are used by the national security community in publications such as Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction No. 1253 [CNSSI 1253] to provide guidance specific to systems designated as national security systems. Whenever possible, the controls have been mapped to international standards to help ensure maximum usability and applicability. The relationship of this publication to other risk management, security, privacy, and publications can be found at [FISMA IMP]. </p>
<h2 id="15-revisions-and-extensions">1.5 Revisions and Extensions</h2>
<p>The security and privacy controls described in this publication represent the state-of-the-practice protection measures for individuals, information systems, and organizations. The controls are reviewed and revised periodically to reflect the experience gained from using the controls; new or revised laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards; changing security and privacy requirements; emerging threats, vulnerabilities, attack and information processing methods; and the availability of new technologies.</p>
<p>The security and privacy controls in the control catalog are also expected to change over time as controls are withdrawn, revised, and added. In addition to the need for change, the need for stability is addressed by requiring that proposed modifications to security and privacy controls go through a rigorous and transparent public review process to obtain   public and private sector feedback and to build a consensus for such change. The review process provides a technically sound, flexible, and stable set of security and privacy controls for the organizations that use the control catalog.</p>
<h2 id="16-publication-organization">1.6 Publication Organization</h2>
<p>This site is organized so that the Controls can be easily navigated. Even though the Fundamentals are present, this site does not include references, glossary, acronyms and summaries in the original document. However, this does implement rev. 5.</p>
