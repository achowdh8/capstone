<h3 id="10">10</h3>
<h3 id="software-firmware-and-information-integrity-protection-of-boot-firmware">Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity | Protection of Boot Firmware</h3>
<p>Implement the following mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware in [Assignment: organization-defined system components]: [Assignment: organization-defined mechanisms].</p>
<p>Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may indicate a sophisticated, targeted attack. These types of targeted attacks can result in a permanent denial of service or a persistent malicious code presence. These situations can occur if the firmware is corrupted or if the malicious code is embedded within the firmware. System components can protect the integrity of boot firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of all updates to the firmware prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot firmware.</p>

<p>Implement cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the following software or firmware components prior to installation: [Assignment: organization-defined software or firmware components].</p>
<p>Cryptographic authentication includes verifying that software or firmware components have been digitally signed using certificates recognized and approved by organizations. Code signing is an effective method to protect against malicious code. Organizations that employ cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions.</p>

<p>Prohibit processes from executing without supervision for more than [Assignment: organization-defined time period].</p>
<p>Placing a time limit on process execution without supervision is intended to apply to processes for which typical or normal execution periods can be determined and situations in which organizations exceed such periods. Supervision includes timers on operating systems, automated responses, and manual oversight and response when system process anomalies occur.</p>
<h3 id="17">17</h3>
<h3 id="software-firmware-and-information-integrity-runtime-application-self-protection">Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity | Runtime Application Self-protection</h3>
<p>Implement [Assignment: organization-defined controls] for application self-protection at runtime.</p>
<p>Runtime application self-protection employs runtime instrumentation to detect and block the exploitation of software vulnerabilities by taking advantage of information from the software in execution. Runtime exploit prevention differs from traditional perimeter-based protections such as guards and firewalls which can only detect and block attacks by using network information without contextual awareness. Runtime application self-protection technology can reduce the susceptibility of software to attacks by monitoring its inputs and blocking those inputs that could allow attacks. It can also help protect the runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. When a threat is detected, runtime application self-protection technology can prevent exploitation and take other actions (e.g., sending a warning message to the user, terminating the user's session, terminating the application, or sending an alert to organizational personnel). Runtime application self-protection solutions can be deployed in either a monitor or protection mode.</p>
