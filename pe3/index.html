<h2 id="control">Control</h2>
<p>a. Enforce physical access authorizations at [Assignment: organization-defined entry and exit points to the facility where the system resides] by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and</li>
<li>Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined physical access control systems or devices]; guards];</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Maintain physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined entry or exit points];</p>
<p>c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing the following controls: [Assignment: organization-defined physical access controls];</p>
<p>d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances requiring visitor escorts and control of visitor activity];</p>
<p>e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;</p>
<p>f. Inventory [Assignment: organization-defined physical access devices] every [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and</p>
<p>g. Change combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical access controls for publicly accessible areas may include physical access control logs/records, guards, or physical access devices and barriers to prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas. Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional security staff, system users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers. Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the components.</p>

<h3 id="1">1</h3>
<h3 id="physical-access-control-system-access">Physical Access Control | System Access</h3>
<p>Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at [Assignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more components of the system].</p>
<p>Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system components.</p>
<h3 id="2">2</h3>
<h3 id="physical-access-control-facility-and-systems">Physical Access Control | Facility and Systems</h3>
<p>Perform security checks [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at the physical perimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system components.</p>
<p>Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration.</p>

<h3 id="3">3</h3>
<h3 id="physical-access-control-continuous-guards">Physical Access Control | Continuous Guards</h3>
<p>Employ guards to control [Assignment: organization-defined physical access points] to the facility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.</p>
<p>Employing guards at selected physical access points to the facility provides a more rapid response capability for organizations. Guards also provide the opportunity for human surveillance in areas of the facility not covered by video surveillance.</p>

<h3 id="physical-access-control-lockable-casings">Physical Access Control | Lockable Casings</h3>
<p>Use lockable physical casings to protect [Assignment: organization-defined system components] from unauthorized physical access.</p>
<p>The greatest risk from the use of portable devices—such as smart phones, tablets, and notebook computers—is theft. Organizations can employ lockable, physical casings to reduce or eliminate the risk of equipment theft. Such casings come in a variety of sizes, from units that protect a single notebook computer to full cabinets that can protect multiple servers, computers, and peripherals. Lockable physical casings can be used in conjunction with cable locks or lockdown plates to prevent the theft of the locked casing containing the computer equipment.</p>
<h3 id="5">5</h3>
<h3 id="physical-access-control-tamper-protection">Physical Access Control | Tamper Protection</h3>
<p>Employ [Assignment: organization-defined anti-tamper technologies] to [Selection (one or more): detect; prevent] physical tampering or alteration of [Assignment: organization-defined hardware components] within the system.</p>
<p>Organizations can implement tamper detection and prevention at selected hardware components or implement tamper detection at some components and tamper prevention at other components. Detection and prevention activities can employ many types of anti-tamper technologies, including tamper-detection seals and anti-tamper coatings. Anti-tamper programs help to detect hardware alterations through counterfeiting and other supply chain-related risks.</p>

<h3 id="physical-access-control-physical-barriers">Physical Access Control | Physical Barriers</h3>
<p>Limit access using physical barriers.</p>
<p>Physical barriers include bollards, concrete slabs, jersey walls, and hydraulic active vehicle barriers.</p>
<h3 id="8">8</h3>
<h3 id="physical-access-control-access-control-vestibules">Physical Access Control | Access Control Vestibules</h3>
<p>Employ access control vestibules at [Assignment: organization-defined locations within the facility].</p>
<p>An access control vestibule is part of a physical access control system that typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Vestibules are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in unauthorized access to the facility. Interlocking door controllers can be used to limit the number of individuals who enter controlled access points and to provide containment areas while authorization for physical access is verified. Interlocking door controllers can be fully automated (i.e., controlling the opening and closing of the doors) or partially automated (i.e., using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the containment area).</p>
