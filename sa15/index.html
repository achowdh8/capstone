<p>a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;</li>
<li>Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;</li>
<li>Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and</li>
<li>Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and</li>
</ol>
<p>b. Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the following security and privacy requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy requirements].</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes facilitates effective supply chain risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.</p>

<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-quality-metrics">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Quality Metrics</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:</p>
<p>(a) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and</p>
<p>(b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment: organization-defined program review milestones]; upon delivery].</p>
<h3 id="2">2</h3>
<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-security-and-privacy-tracking-tools">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Security and Privacy Tracking Tools</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and employ security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.</p>

<h3 id="3">3</h3>
<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-criticality-analysis">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Criticality Analysis</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality analysis:</p>
<p>(a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle]; and</p>
<p>(b) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis].</p>
<p>Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.</p>

<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-attack-surface-reduction">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Attack Surface Reduction</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces to [Assignment: organization-defined thresholds].</p>
<p>Attack surface reduction is closely aligned with threat and vulnerability analyses and system architecture and design. Attack surface reduction is a means of reducing risk to organizations by giving attackers less opportunity to exploit weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e., potential vulnerabilities) within systems, system components, and system services. Attack surface reduction includes implementing the concept of layered defenses, applying the principles of least privilege and least functionality, applying secure software development practices, deprecating unsafe functions, reducing entry points available to unauthorized users, reducing the amount of code that executes, and eliminating application programming interfaces (APIs) that are vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>Developers of systems, system components, and system services consider the effectiveness and efficiency of their development processes for meeting quality objectives and addressing the security and privacy capabilities in current threat environments.</p>
<h3 id="7">7</h3>
<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-automated-vulnerability-analysis">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Automated Vulnerability Analysis</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to:</p>
<p>(a) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: organization-defined tools];</p>
<p>(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;</p>
<p>(c) Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and</p>
<p>(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].</p>
<p>Automated tools can be more effective at analyzing exploitable weaknesses or deficiencies in large and complex systems, prioritizing vulnerabilities by severity, and providing recommendations for risk mitigations.</p>

<h3 id="11">11</h3>
<h3 id="development-process-standards-and-tools-archive-system-or-component">Development Process, Standards, and Tools | Archive System or Component</h3>
<p>Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final security and privacy review.</p>
<p>Archiving system or system components requires the developer to retain key development artifacts, including hardware specifications, source code, object code, and relevant documentation from the development process that can provide a readily available configuration baseline for system and component upgrades or modifications.</p>
